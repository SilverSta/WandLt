## Description 

- Water and Life technologies is a product intended to reach the more vulnerable populations around the world
- Its main purpose is to purify water and make it drinkable for those who can barely access this resource with a safe supply
- With the help of solar energy and IoT the solution will be capable of reaching vulnerable populations and supply them with potable water

## How to use

- In order to deploy this device, first it must be configured with the IoT respective protocol (Currently using Wi-Fi for testing purposes) In the future is intended to be used with LoRa Wan IoT protocol communication. once the IoT protocol has been stablished it will be capable of being remotely monitored and managed by an operator or automatically with the help of IA (Watson).
- The solar panel will be ready to use after the IoT configuration measuring the sun light incidence and searching for the best angle to receive the lightest and have a high efficiency ratio.
- Modular intended: the device will allow to switch between some features such as the tanks capacities, solar pane size, distribution pipes, recollection pipes. It will be a feature specifically to the region aimed to be used in
- AI(Watson) data management: The main purpose of AI in the project is to optimize and get the data from all the dispositive deployed, this data will be used to evaluate the impact that each dispositive is having in the respective zone making use of it, The second reason is to allow the machine to get smarter and allow it to get better readings for each water variable that can affect the final water quality.

## Technologies

- The water will be filtered using a reverse osmosis filter, it will to have two main tanks (pre filtered water and filtered water) using a water pump the water will be transported from the pre filter tank through the reverse osmosis filter, then will pass a series of sensors (PH and particulate matter) and measures the final water quality
- IA (Watson IBM) this will allow the analysis of the data collected and optimizing purposes
- Solar pane this feature is intended to be the main power supply of the machine and allowing it to be used anywhere in the world
- Water pumps switchable technology that allows the water flow through all the dispositive collection

## IBM techs

- As part in the building process of our modular recollection and purifying systems of water, we take on count that in the world are many climatological variables so its indispensable adding an Artificial Intelligence that let us evaluate all the obtained by the units and estimate possible situations that may affect the water supply from the purification unit
- A data base already has been designed with different climatological variables such as Temperature, Relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed, precipitation, in order to let the IA evaluate the condition which the machine can operate normally
